# Additional Update Guidelines for dtrace

As a reminder, these are *guidelines*. The version you update to might make some of these steps obsolete, so make sure you understand what they do and why they're necessary.

## Generates Sources

_In the prior release, the source files were generated by XCode and copied over. If you are able to figure out how to build dtrace from XCode, you can copy over those generated files instead._

```bash sh
mkdir -p gen/libdtrace
cd gen/libdtrace
bison -b y -d ../../lib/libdtrace/common/dt_grammar.y
flex ../../lib/libdtrace/common/dt_lex.l
```
