# Building for the WSL

The Windows Subsystem for Linux (or WSL for short) allows you to run Linux programs on a Windows system.

Darling should work with no problems on WSL2, as this is essentially a standard virtual machine with a full Linux kernel. WSL1 is more complicated and is not currently working.

As Darling no longer uses a Linux Kernel Module, no special instructions are needed for either WSL1 or WSL2. Use the standard [Linux build instructions](build-instructions.md).
