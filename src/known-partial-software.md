# Known partially working software
The following software has been tested and is known to work partially with Darling:

- Classic Finder (https://classicmacfinder.com/).
  - Source code: https://bitbucket.org/bszyman/classic-finder-app/src/develop/
  - Works, but has the following bugs:
  - Menubar not visible anywhere.
  - Windows cannot be closed after they lose focus - the window decorations disappear.
  - Sometimes does not respond when trying to browse to system folders.
  - Runs very slowly.
- dotnet (the commandline compiler).
  - Very minimal "hello world" applications compile and run.
